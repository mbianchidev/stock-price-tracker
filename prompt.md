   - Success criteria: Data is accurate, up-to-date, and visually distinguishes positive/negative changes

3. **Basic Company Information**
   - What it does: Displays company name and basic details alongside price data
   - Why it matters: Provides context for the stock data
   - Success criteria: Information is accurate and relevant

4. **Real-time API Integration**
   - What it does: Connects to Alpha Vantage API to fetch real stock market data
   - Why it matters: Provides accurate and up-to-date information instead of mock data
   - Success criteria: Successfully retrieves and displays current stock information with proper error handling

### API Integration

URL for fetching stock data:
https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=GLOBAL_QUOTE&symbol=IBM&apikey=demo

Format of the response is this

{
    "Global Quote": {
        "01. symbol": "IBM",
        "02. open": "252.5000",
        "03. high": "253.8100",
        "04. low": "244.6500",
        "05. price": "253.6900",
        "06. volume": "4609520",
        "07. latest trading day": "2025-05-12",
        "08. previous close": "249.2000",
        "09. change": "4.4900",
        "10. change percent": "1.8018%"
    }
}

API Key: demo (for testing purposes, will later replace with a valid key for production)

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence, clarity, reliability
- **Design Personality**: Professional yet approachable, clean and straightforward
- **Visual Metaphors**: Financial dashboard, information cards
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface to focus on the data itself

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with accent colors for positive/negative values
- **Primary Color**: Blue (professional, trustworthy)
- **Secondary Colors**: Light neutrals for backgrounds and containers
- **Accent Color**: Green for positive values, red for negative values
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: Dark text on light backgrounds (4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Sans-serif for all text with varying weights for hierarchy
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Bold headings, regular body text, medium for important values
- **Font Personality**: Professional, clean, highly readable
- **Which fonts**: 'Inter', sans-serif (Google font)
- **Legibility Check**: High contrast, appropriate sizing for all screen sizes

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Focus on the stock symbol search at top, then price data, then supporting information
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing between elements to create clear visual separation
- **Grid System**: Single column on mobile, two columns on desktop for search and results
- **Content Density**: Low density with focus on key metrics

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Search input, cards for stock data, buttons for actions
- **Component States**: Clear hover and focus states for all interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Financial icons to represent different data types
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 4px/8px spacing scale throughout

## Implementation Considerations
- **API Integration**: Uses Alpha Vantage API for fetching real-time stock data
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for API request failures and invalid symbols
- **Performance**: Optimized to minimize API calls and handle rate limiting
- **Scalability Needs**: May expand to include historical data or charts in the future
- **Testing Focus**: Validate API integration and error handling
